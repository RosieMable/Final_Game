  _spiritDescription: "It is a tradition for a Berserker to be blessed by a god as
    a form of oath to die in battle, this one found the attention of a different being.
    Tricked into believing he held a seat in his faiths afterlife he pushed forth
    bringing bloodshed for the wrong god.\r\nWhen he finally fell in battle instead
    of the smell of ale and the cheers of his brothers and sisters, he found the endless
    expanse. Desperation led to denial as he set forth to die again in what he perceived
    a test. Only to the amusement of powerful eyes watching his plight.\r"
