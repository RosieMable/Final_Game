  _spiritDescription: "When a man becomes a legend, what does he forsake for the honor?
    \r\nThe rolling hills and vast green planes of the south birthed many a great
    legend, as the nomads and druids that call them home will tell you, but they will
    do so with a pang of great sadness in their eyes. For when a man stands atop a
    mound of his fallen comrades and utters words in an otherworldly tongue, healing
    every cut and gash as unknowable forces stitch life back into their hearts, he
    becomes a legend. \r\nBut he also becomes feared, for what is the difference between
    him and the spirit masters he serves? He becomes a legend, and his story will
    be written on the stars forever, but he forsakes his humanity. He can never go
    home.\r"
